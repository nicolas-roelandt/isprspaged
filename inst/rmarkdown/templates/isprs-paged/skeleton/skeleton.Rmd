  "These guidelines are provided for preparation of <strong>full papers submitted to ISPRS events</strong> (Congress, Geospatial Week, Symposia, smaller events). If the double-blind review process leads to acceptance, they will be either published in the series of Volumes of The International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences or of The ISPRS Annals of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences.<br /> 
  These guidelines are issued to ensure a uniform style for all submitted papers and throughout these two series. All papers that are accepted by the relevant scientific committee of an ISPRS event will be published provided they arrive by the due date and they correspond to these guidelines. Reproduction is made directly from author-prepared manuscripts, in electronic or hardcopy form, in A4 paper size 297 mm x 210 mm (11.69 x 8.27 inches). To assure timely and efficient production of the Archives and Annals with a consistent and easy to read format, authors must submit their manuscripts in strict conformance with these guidelines. The Society may omit any paper that does not conform to the specified requirements."

# MANUSCRIPT


## General Instructions

The paper should have the following structure:

1.  Title of the paper
2.  Authors and affiliation, rendered **anonymous**
3.  Keywords (6--8 words)
4.  Abstract (100--250 words)
5.  Introduction
6.  Main body
7.  Conclusions
8.  Acknowledgements, rendered **anonymous**
9.  References
10. Appendix (if applicable)

Full papers **submitted for double-blind review** must not contain any
information which makes it possible to identify the authors. In
particular, names and affiliations must be removed from the manuscript
submitted for review. Also sentences such as "As we have shown in
previous work (Author\_x, 20xx)" are to be avoided. Instead use a
formulation such as "Author\_x (20xx) has shown \...". Note that
submissions which have not been appropriately anonymised may be subject
to immediate rejection.\
In case, the contribution has been accepted for publication, a
camera-ready manuscript must be submitted at the due date. In this
camera-ready manuscript the name(s) and affiliation(s) of the authors(s)
must be identified, and acknowledgements can be personalized.

## Page Layout, Spacing and Margins

The paper must be compiled in one column for the Title and Abstract and
in two columns for all subsequent text. All text should be
single-spaced, unless otherwise stated. Left and right justified typing
is preferred.

## Preparation in electronic form

To assist authors in preparing their contributions, styleguides are
provided in Word and/or LaTeX on the ISPRS web Page, see:
http://www.isprs.org/documents/orangebook/app5.aspx.

## Length and Font

All manuscripts, except Invited Papers are limited to a length of
approximately eight (8) single-spaced pages (A4 size), including
abstracts, figures, tables and references. ISPRS Invited Papers are
limited to approximately twelve (12) pages. In any case, the minimum
length is six (6) pages. The font type Times New Roman with a size of
nine (9) points is to be used.

# TITLE AND ABSTRACT BLOCK

## Title

The title should appear centred in bold capital letters, at the top of
the first page of the paper with a size of twelve (12) points and
single-spacing. Author(s) name(s), affiliation and mailing address
should be masked. They will only appear in the final version if the
paper is accepted either in the ISPRS Annals or Archives.

## ISPRS Affiliation (optional)

For those authors affiliated with a specific Commission and/or Working
Group of ISPRS, a separate title may be entered. The title should be
centred in bold type after one blank line below the author's
affiliation, i.e. Commission \#, Working Group \#. The Commission number
shall be Roman and the Working Group number should be the Commission
Roman number, slash, WG Arabic number (see example above).

## Key Words

Leave two lines blank, then type **"KEY WORDS:"** in bold capital
letters, followed by 5--8 key words. Note that ISPRS does not provide a
set list of key words any longer. Therefore, include those key words
which you would use to find a paper with content you are preparing.

## Abstract

Leave two blank lines under the key words. Type **"ABSTRACT:"** flush
left in bold Capitals followed by one blank line. Start now with a
concise Abstract (100--250 words) which presents briefly the content and
very importantly, the news and results of the paper in words
understandable also to non-specialists.

# MAIN BODY OF TEXT

Type text single-spaced, **with** one blank line between paragraphs and
following headings. Start paragraphs flush with left margin.

## Headings

Major headings are to be centred, in bold capitals without underlining,
after two blank lines and followed by a one blank line.

Type subheadings flush with the left margin in bold upper case and lower
case letters. Subheadings are on a separate line between two single
blank lines.

Subsubheadings are to be typed in bold upper case and lower case letters
after one blank line flush with the left margin of the page, with text
following on the same line. Subsubheadings may be followed by a period
or colon, they may also be the first word of the paragraph's sentence.

Use decimal numbering for headings and subheadings.

## Footnotes

Mark footnotes in the text with a number (1); use consecutive numbers
for following footnotes. Place footnotes at the bottom of the page,
separated from the text above it by a horizontal line.

## Illustrations and Tables

### Placement: {-}

Figures must be placed in the appropriate location in the document, as
close as practicable to the reference of the figure in the text. While
figures and tables are usually aligned horizontally on the page, large
figures and tables sometimes need to be turned on their sides. If you
must turn a figure or table sideways, please be sure that the top is
always on the left-hand side of the page.

### Captions:

All captions should be typed in upper and lower case letters, centred
directly beneath the illustration. Use single spacing if they use more
than one line. All captions are to be numbered consecutively, e.g.
Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, .. and Table 1, Table 2, Table 3, \...

```{r, results='hide'}
caption <- "Figure placement and numbering."
fig_nums(name = "fig1", caption = caption)
```

```{r fig1, eval=TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/test_sites/fig1.png")
```

`r paste0('<p class="caption">',fig_nums("fig1"), '</p>')`

## Equations, Symbols and Units
### Equations:

Equations should be numbered consecutively throughout the contribution.
The equation number is enclosed in parentheses and placed flush right.
Leave one blank lines before and after equations:

$$\label{equ:1}
    x = x_0 -c \frac{X - X_0}{Z - Z_0}; y = y_0 -c \frac{Y - Y_0}{Z - Z_0},$$

<!-- Tabbing not working properly-->
where   $c$ = principle distance  
  $x,y$ = image coordinates  
  $X_0,Y_0, Z_0$ = coordinates of projection centre  
  $X, Y, Z$ = object coordinates
  
### Symbols and Units:

Use the SI (Système International) Units and Symbols. Unusual characters
or symbols should be explained in a list of nomenclature.
